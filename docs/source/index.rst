Quick Start
==========================================================
QuecOpen is an open source embedded development platform based on Linux system, which is intended to simplify the design and development process for IoT applications.

**High-powered Platform**              

With characteristics of high real-time, multithread and micro kernel, etc., QuecOpen transparently manages all LTE related activities to allow developers to natively execute C, C++ and shell script based program on the processor and in the memory of Quectel modules.

**Fast Development**

QuecOpen SDK provides rich small examples, which enables developers to realize fast development. Supporting      C-based runtime libraries offers more flexibility for developers to design software and program.

**More Competitive**

By directly downloading the embedded applications to Quectel modules to run, it is now possible to remove external host processor, memory, and a range of product specific ASICs such as IO expanders, audio DSPs, and many other analogue and digital devices.
